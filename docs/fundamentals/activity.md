# Activity

Activity allows you to view each individual execution of a Workflow. Each time you execute a Workflow, an activity is associated with this execution. The system keeps information on Workflow status, Workflow duration, Task status, Task duration, output properties, and logs.

## Activity Snapshot

Select **View Activity** from the menu on any Workflow to access the Activity page.

The Activity page provides a snapshot breakdown with the ability to filter by:

- Status
- Team
- Workflow
- Trigger method
- Date range

Additional information for start time and duration will be displayed, along with visual markers to match the status. The **In Progress** tab will pulsate through a range of the status colors.

Click an individual activity card to view the activity execution detail.

## Activity Execution Detail

The activity execution detail is a read-only view of your Workflow design with a visual indication of both the status of each Task, as well as the link state.
