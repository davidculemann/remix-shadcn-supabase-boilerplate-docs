# Manage

## Team Parameters

Team parameters are one of the scopes of the parameter layering available. The Parameter management screen allows you to create, edit, and delete Team parameters.

## Team Approvers

Manage groups of users to easily set as approvers. Groups can only be formed with users from the same Team.

## Team Tasks

Team Tasks are scoped to a specific team and only visible by that team in the Task palette as part of the Workflow Editor.

> **Note:** When exporting a Workflow that references a Team Task, it can only be imported to a team that has the same Task.

### Workflow Editors

In the Workflow Editor, Team Tasks are still found in the Task palette and are denoted by the words: 'Team Task' underneath the name of the Task.

## Team Tokens

Team tokens allow you to create and remove team-scoped API tokens that enable actions against the API.
