# Actions

The centralized place for all Approval and Manual tasks that need action. Think of this as your Action to-do list. It is also a great place to see an audit record of who approved what and when. Optimizing your Approval process, coupled with automation, allows you to cut costs, save time, and improve productivity.

While driving towards fully automated approvals, there are always cases where manual approval may be needed. For instance:

- To provide sign-off/approval for audit purposes such as with quarterly reviews.
- Providing sign-off/approval before refunds are processed.
- Approving new hire onboarding or reviewing their paperwork.
- Approving vacation requests.

The Actions page provides a view of Approvals or Manual Tasks, and you can filter these by Scope, Team, Workflow, Status, and Dates.

## Approvals

Approvals are checks that need to occur prior to automation taking place, meaning the Workflow won't move forward until all necessary approvals are in place.

The Approval will provide details of how many approvers are needed and provide a space for any comments.

## Manual Tasks
