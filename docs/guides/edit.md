# Customize a Workflow with Editor

Click any Workflow tile to open the Editor page for that Workflow. The editor is where Workflows are created and managed. You define everything to do with your Workflow, including designing the model, triggers, options, and properties.

### Features

- Conditional switches
- Link state logic
- Triggers
- Persistent storage
- Parallelism
- Notes

Here, you define the Workflow using the following data entry properties and attributes. A dynamic graphical user interface is provided for defining the flow.

- **Workflow** - This tab displays an advanced visual drag-and-drop no-code Workflow editor, along with a panel of Tasks to configure in the editor.
- **Properties** - This tab accesses properties that can be defined or updated for the Workflow.
- **Configure** - This tab accesses triggers and optional controls that further refine the Workflow.
- **Change Log** - The Change Log displays metrics that give you insight into the history and health of the Workflow.
- **Add a Task** - The controls in this panel allow you to define Tasks that will be called in the Workflow.
