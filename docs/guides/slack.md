# Using the Slack App

An embedded contextual experience letting you kick-off automation right within Slack, giving you complete control over what needs to be done.

The app can be used for various purposes, such as responding to incidents, sending emails, or onboarding new team members. Everything can be automated and triggered from Slack.

> Note: The Slack app needs to be installed in your Workspace for this to work.

## Command Reference

In Slack, you can use the following slash commands:

- `/workflow help` - Show usage information.
- `/workflow {workflowId}` - Run a workflow.

> Note: `/workflow` may be replaced with a different command for the specific installation.

## Running a Workflow

You can run automation with the slash command `/workflow {id}`.

You will then be shown a modal with basic information for you to confirm it's the workflow you wish to run.

Select 'Run It' to kick start the automation.

A response will then be posted to you from the app with the activity details.
