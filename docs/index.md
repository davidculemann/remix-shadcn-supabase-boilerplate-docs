## How to Use These Docs

- **Tutorials**: These are step-by-step guides that walk you through building a specific app. They're great for getting started with Remix and learning the basics.
- **Discussions**: These help you understand Remix by diving into a topic and how various APIs work together to meet use cases or explain some behavior that might not be obvious just from the API.
- **Reference**: These are the docs for the APIs and conventions that Remix provides. They're great for looking up how to use a specific API or feature but don't contain a lot of conversation about how to use them together.
- **Guides**: They're great for learning how to use Remix in a specific way or for a specific use case.
